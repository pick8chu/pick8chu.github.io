I'm at work. I finished assignments that had given to me. I was searching for some interesting topics that I wanna fall in, but for now, can't really think of anything. I was watching a tutorial video of making a card game with Unity, but that was little too boring without trying it.

Due to a proxy problem, it's really limited what I could do at the work place. I can't even download jekyll here, which is quite annoying. Android studio is also one of those, well, I could download Android studio but cannot use most of APIs.

I was thinking of reading a book, but I know it will make me very tired, so I decided not to. I've been reading 'eat pray love' for about a year now. I gave up on reading it, cause it just wasn't my kind of a book. But about a month ago I picked it up again and started reading it from where I left. And then, the author talked about something really cool, and I liked the part very much. It was about how you have to live in present and be optimistic. Here is the quote;
> You are, after all, what you think. Your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts, and you are the slave to your emotions.The other problem with all this winging through the vines of thought is that you are never where you are. You are always digging in the past or poking at the future, but rarely do you rest in this moment.

I couldn't agree more. As a christian, I haven't really worry about my future. Of course I worry about where I will be ended up, but I know eventually it will all be figured out for the best. Anyway, so this was the page that I read and thought, 'wow, this book might have more things to tell me'. And since then, I've read around 30 pages(I know I'm slow at reading), but haven't found anything intresting so far.

I like Paulo Coelho, he always tries to deliver his intentions, and that allows me to see things in different perspectives. I hate the thought that your daily life constrain you from seeing things differently. Like, you are so used to do something in a specific way, all other ways are just not right to you. You put yourself in a frame. Sometimes, I find myself doing that. I guess it's good to realize every so often that you are wrong, so you could guide yourself to thr right direction.
