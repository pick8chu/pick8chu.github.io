So WAS is basically the same with Server(so called), such as tomcat. 
This webpage which doesn't have any dynamic changes is considered as a WEB server.

WAS enables the WEB server to have WEB container. 
WEB container has controllers that recieve request(such as API) and response with data.

Therefore, with WAS, clients can request data and receive them. 

### Conclusion

- WAS: Regular website where client requests and receive.
- WEB: Static website, like this website. none of this is from database, it's just innated in HTML.
