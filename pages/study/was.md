## WAS

[Check here](https://gmlwjd9405.github.io/2018/10/27/webserver-vs-was.html)

So WAS is basically the same with Server(so called), such as tomcat. 
This webpage which doesn't have any dynamic changes is considered as a WEB container.

WAS enables the WEB container to have WEB server. 
WEB server has controllers that recieve request(such as API) and response with data.

Therefore, with WAS, clients can request data and receive them. 

### Conclusion

WAS: Regular website where client requests and receive.
WEB: Static website, like this website. none of this is from database, it's just innated in HTML.
